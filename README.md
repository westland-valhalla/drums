Drum Workout

- You must train for several months, prior to your first real workout.
- It is not how heavy you lift, it is how long you lift your heavy for.
- If you have to stop then, it is too heavy.
- A workout should last over two hours.
- Don't lay.
- Don't pretend.
- Stop Pretending.
- Focus.
- Never use machines that require sitting or laying down.
- Don't swing weights.
- Don't use your phone.
- Don't rest.
- Don't sit.
- Don't take days off.
- Don't eat cheat meals. Don't talk.
- Are you pretending?
- Are you swinging your weights?
- Did you sit down?
- Are you resting now?
- Did you give up?
- If you had to stop then you chose weights that are just too heavy for you to lift.
- Don't rest, use a lower weight during your rest.
- A workout must be non stop, once you stop, it is over, you go home, rest and workout a little bit longer the next day.
- Do not pretend to work out, the only person you are cheating at a gym is yourself. In a few weeks people will notice that you made no progress and will think less of you.
- If you feel that you are too large to begin your workout at the gym, you should start at the Appalachian Trail or similar.
- Everything you think you know is wrong, and most of the right things require that you stop pretending that you know how to do it, and actually figure it out by trial and error on your own.
- Don't copy workouts, chances are they are not working out.
- There is no such thing as sets and reps, your body will not receive the signal to adapt your musculature if you just workout for two minutes an hour.
- A Workout is similar to reaching Mount Everest. Before you arrive you have to educate your mind and incrementally prepare your body by increasing its endurance.
- If you just dress yourself to look like everybody else, get the same equipment, and notebooks, and even friends; you will not triumph, you will either give up, fail, or die a stupid and worthless death.
- Working out without months of training and preparations leading up to your workout, will result in lethargy, dehydration, injury, and death.
- If you do end up working out every day but fail to show progress in a few weeks, then people will know you just spent a few weeks pretending to work out.
- If You lift heavy to pretend you are a bad ass, those who will notice you, will see that you are sitting around pretending to rest your legs to an arm workout, while playing with your phone in the middle of a gym.
